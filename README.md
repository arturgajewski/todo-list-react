# Tasks List

## Description

Do you often forget what you had to do? If so, thanks to my application you will be able to create your own to-do list and thanks to it you will not forget anything.
This application is easy to use and very intuitive.
If you do not know how to use it, you can watch the instructional video by clicking on (Preview) in the menu.

I wish you the memory of an elephant :)
